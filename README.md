Subreddit Subscriptions using Node.js, Express, Angular, and MongoDB.

[Check it out here](https://subreddit-subscriptions.herokuapp.com).

## What does it do?
Read the top posts of a list of subscribed subreddits, all in one place.

Simply search for a subreddit to add it to the list, or import an existing list from a JSON file.

## Why?
Do you have a lot of subreddits you want to keep up with daily?

For example, what if you are subscribed to /r/gamedeals and don't want to miss limited time offers?

Reddit allows you to subscribe to subreddits and view them on your home page.
However sorting by "top" sorts posts by upvotes, which disproportionately represents larger subreddits that have more users to vote on posts.
This app allows you to customize which subreddits you want to see, and in what order.

It also provides keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation.
